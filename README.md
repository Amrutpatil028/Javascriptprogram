# JavaScript Program

This repository contains JavaScript programs and examples demonstrating various string operations, mathematical operations, and programming concepts.

## Files

- `01_code.js`: Initial JavaScript code example with basic operations.
- `02_stringcode.js`: String manipulation examples including length, case conversion, indexing, slicing, replacing, concatenation, trimming, and splitting.
- `02_stringreverse.js`: String reversal implementation that reverses a given string character by character.
- `03_swapthenumber.js`: Number swapping program demonstrating two methods: using a temporary variable and using arithmetic operations.
- `04_even_odd_number.js`: Program to check if a number is even or odd using modulo operator.
- `05_Largestofthreenumbers.js`: Program to find the largest among three numbers using conditional statements.

## How to Run

To run any of these programs, use Node.js:

```bash
node <filename>.js
```

For example:
```bash
node 01_code.js
node 03_swapthenumber.js
node 05_Largestofthreenumbers.js
```

## Features

- String manipulation methods
- String reversal algorithms
- Number swapping techniques (with/without temporary variable)
- Even/Odd number detection
- Conditional logic and comparisons
- Basic JavaScript operations
